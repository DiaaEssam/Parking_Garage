# Parking_Garage
1- This project is about designing a Parking Garage system for any organization where we focus on certain issues:<br/>
&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;  1- We let the Garage owner choose the way he/she wants to park vehicles.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;2- there are two ways: <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;        1- Best Fit, where we put the vehicle in the appropriate slot that fits the vehicle's dimensions perfectly (saving &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;space).<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;        2- First come First serve, where we put the vehicle in any slot while this slot's dimensions can contain the &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;vehicle's dimensions and no need for perfect fitting(saving time).<br/>
<br/>
