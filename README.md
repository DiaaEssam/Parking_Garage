# Parking_Garage
1- This project is about designing a Parking Garage system for any organization where we focus on certain issues:
    1- We let the Garage owner choose the way he/she wants to park vehicles.
    2- there are two ways: 
        1- Best Fit, where we put the vehicle in the appropriate slot that fits the vehicle's dimensions perfectly (saving space).
        2- First come First serve, where we put the vehicle in any slot while this slot's dimensions can contain the vehicle's dimensions and no need for perfect fitting(saving time).

2- This project's files all written in java.
